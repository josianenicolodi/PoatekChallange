* [Project Description](#descrição-do-projeto)

     Project consists of Poatek Internship Program Challenge. I developed the programming logic exercises and database exercises.
     The logic exercises are in main and for the database exercises I created a subfolder where I put prints of the solved exercises. Each file created has the                description in the name and a photo attached with the code with the answer.

* [Technologies used](#tecnologias-utilizadas)
 
 
 
     For programming logic exercises I used Python. For the database exercises I used Azure Data Studio with PostgreSQL extension.
